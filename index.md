I am studying Networking and Information Technology at Carleton University from 2018-2023. Following university, I plan on entering into the field of network or system administration. Using my homelab, I stay up to date on popular cloud and enterprise solutions such as Kubernetes and VMware vSphere. Keep up with me by checking out my blog and take a look at my resume.
